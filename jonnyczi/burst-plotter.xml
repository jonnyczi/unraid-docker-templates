    - Create txt files in the location you would like to place your plots with your desired configuration baked in the file name (ex.: 806072864698000319_4096_4096_1024.txt)
      - If it detects a plot file matching your txt file it will skip it to prevent accidental loss of plot files
      - Works recursively, create the txt files in sub directories if you wish
      - Every txt file found will run a new instance of the plotter at the same time as the others WATCH YOUR RAM!

    - Mount your plot directories to /plots in the container
      - If using multiple volumes mount them in sub directories inside /plots (ex.: /plots/volume1)
    [br][br]

    - Run the container
      - Verify the output and your files to make sure its working
      - The output of the plotter is not very organized and I'm working on it

    - Todo
      - Unraid friendly (Priority)
      - Find a way to optimize at the same time as plotting (Priority)
      - The output of the plotter is not very organized and I'm working on it
      - Add arguments for number of threads and to choose between SSE4 and AVX2
